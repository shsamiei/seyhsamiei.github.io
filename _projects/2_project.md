Nexarae is an upcoming decentralized oracle service designed to empower blockchain applications with real-world data, verifiable randomness, and advanced off-chain computations. Our project is built on the idea that blockchain applications should be able to access accurate and reliable data feeds without compromising on privacy and security.



Our Vision

At Nexarae, we are reimagining the way oracles operate. Our multi-chain approach ensures compatibility with various blockchain networks, making us a valuable asset for developers across the ecosystem. With a hybrid consensus mechanism and advanced smart contract automation, we aim to lay the foundation for a new era of decentralized applications that can perform complex computations, securely interact with external data, and maintain the utmost privacy.

What's Coming?

While our features are still in development, we are thrilled to share our roadmap with you. Here's a sneak peek at what's on the horizon:


Market Feeds: Secure and reliable data feeds for your applications.
Verifiable Random Functions: Unpredictable randomness for unbiased selections.
Privacy-Preserved Data Retrieval: Innovative use of zero-knowledge technology for enhanced data privacy. 

Stay tuned for updates as we work diligently to bring these features to life.
