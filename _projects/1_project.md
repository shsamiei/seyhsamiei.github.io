This project was an interactive dashboard based on user feedback on the product based on about 3.5 GB of Twitter data in Persian and English. I worked on EDA, building the dashboard, and integrating the models in production. Dashboard Features: Exploratory Data Analysis, Sentiment Analysis, and Topic Detection.
